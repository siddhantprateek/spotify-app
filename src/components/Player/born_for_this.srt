1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,300
I'm checking my vital signs

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,400
Drawing my battle lines

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Going to war again

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,500
Feeling the rhythm inside of my chest

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,300
All I need is just a pen

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,800
I know I was born for this

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,800
I know I was born for this

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,800
Don't care for the critics

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,700
My words are like physics

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,500
A force that they can't stop

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,300
They just don't get it,
I think they forget

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm not done till I'm on top

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,400
I know I was born for this

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,600
I know I was born for this

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,600
I believe, I believe

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,400
We can write our story

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,200
I believe, I believe

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,200
We can be an army

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,900
We are the warriors, who learned
to love the pain

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
We come from different places,
but have the same name

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,600
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,300
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,900
Born for this, we were born for this

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,800
We are the broken ones, who
chose to spark a flame

25
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,500
Watch as our fire rages, our
hearts are never tame

26
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,200
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

28
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,900
Born for this, we were born for this

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
I've struggled for years and

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,300
Through all of the tears

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
I've faced the doubts I hide

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,600
I never gave into my fears deep within

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,600
'Cause I heard my voice inside

34
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,000
I know I was born for this

35
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,200
I know I was born for this

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,900
I will never lose my voice

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
If I cut out all the noise

38
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,800
I know, I was born for this

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,900
I know, I was born for this

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,900
I believe, I believe

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,700
We can write our story

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,500
I believe, I believe

43
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,500
We can be an army

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,300
We are the warriors, who learned
to love the pain

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,900
We come from different places,
but have the same name

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,900
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,700
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,200
Born for this, we were born for this

49
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,000
We are the broken ones, who
chose to spark a flame

50
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,700
Watch as our fire rages, our
hearts are never tame

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

52
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,400
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

53
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,600
Born for this, we were born for this

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,300
These words that I write
are for someone like me

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,100
To know you're not alone

56
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
The moves that you make ya
they come with mistakes

57
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,600
Don't ever lose your hope

58
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,200
Just know, you were born for this

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,700
Just know, you were born for this

60
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,200
We are the warriors, who learned
to love the pain

61
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,900
We come from different places,
but have the same name

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,500
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Born for this, we were born for this

65
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,900
We are the broken ones, who
chose to spark a flame

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,700
Watch as our fire rages, our
hearts are never tame

67
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,500
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,300
'Cause we were, 'cause we were

69
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,700
Born for this, we were born for this

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,400
We were born for this

71
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,700
We were born for this

72
